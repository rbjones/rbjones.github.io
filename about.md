### Who am I

I am a retired software engineer, by profession.
I have a lifetime interest in logic and its automation, and in GOFAI in the form of getting machines to reason formally.
Also in philosophy, but mostly _anti-philosophy_ in the form of various flavours of formal-tech-neo-positivism.
The closest philosopher to my own way of thinking was Rudolf Carnap, though things have moved on, in relevant ways, an awful lot since he was around.
I don't really rate the philosophical movements which have taken place, but the development of formal methods and the technology to support them is significant (tho' still has a long way to go, mainly because it needs real deductive machine intelligence).

### More Information

I am doubling down on a philosophically motivated software and ecosystem development proposal at present, which in multiple forms has been around for many years while I find my way forward.   For 6 years or more I despaired of software development, doubting my own ability to do anything significant, and focussed of philosophical thinking and exposition.  Only recently, the advent of LLMs made me feel that before long I will have sufficient intelligent support from AI to actually get somewhere in developmemt.  Having allowed myself to think that way, I am instantly reminded of the tremendous pull that development work has on me, and am happy once again to think of philosophy as a prelude to action.  Probably unnecessarily, I seem to have a constellation of projects which I have inherited from my former selves, mostly barely progressed at all, under an umbrella enterprise which I have called [StarDust](http://rbjones.github.io/StarDust)
