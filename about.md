### Who am I

I am a retired software engineer, by profession.
I have a lifetime interest in logic and its automation, and in GOFAI in the form of getting machines to reason formally.
Also in philosophy, but mostly _anti-philosophy_ in the form of various flavours of formal-tech-neo-positivism.
The closest philosopher to my own way of thinking was Rudolf Carnap, though things have moved on, in relevant ways, an awful lot since he was around.
I don't really rate the philosophical movements which have taken place, but the development of formal methods and the technology to support them is significant (tho' still has a long way to go, mainly because it needs real deductive machine intelligence).

### More Information

I am doubling down on a philosophically motivated software and ecosystem development proposal at present - [DA-Hol](https://rbjones.github.io/DA-Hol).
This, alongside a companion project I am considering (DA-Value), will probably be my last substantial undertakings, mainly because the ideas are big enough to last a lifetime, even at today's pace of change.
