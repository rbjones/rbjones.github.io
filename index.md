# Projects by Roger Bishop Jones (rbjones)

My active presence at github is now confined to one project, which has had many pre-cursors.

That project is [SPaDE](https://rbjones.github.io/SPaDE), _Synthetic Philosophy and Deductive Engineering_, in which I hope to stabilise and progress the ideas I have been working with for many decades.

If you want to dig into the mess which is the residue of my earlier work, you can find it in various repositories on my GitHub account.
