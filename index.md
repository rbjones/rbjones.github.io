I am now mainly working on the following group of projects:
#  [StarDust](https://rbjones.github.io/StarDust) [repo](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust)

  Stardust is a STEM fantasy which I am attempting to articulate and to realise.
  It is being progressed as a small constellation of projects which together take aim at cosmic cognition with a deductive core, of which the four main components (aligned with Hume's "forks") are:

-  SynEpis - providing philosophical underpinnings for the entire project, under the rubric of "synthetic epistemology" (in that guise focussed on the representation of knowledge) but also straying into architectural aspects of the engineering of that cosmic cognition, and in that way tying together the other three components of StarDust.
d  formal derivation.

- HoLoTruth - This is the part of the project focussed on the a-priori or logical knowledge which underpins all other declarative knowledge.
It is here that the core problem of achieving real machine intelligence is addressed, all other components being concerned with its application.
A central feature of the approach is the extension of the LCF (theorem proving) paragdigm to a broader computational approach to correct inference by verified algorithm.
It is a code verification first approach to machine intelligence.

- HoLoMod - Concerned with the use of HoLoTruth for modelling the empirical world. and engaging with it.
Its central focus is on achieving a general design and build capability, in which the use of formal models enables the engineering of real world systems meeting known requirements and connection to agentic capabilities and the effects of smart contracting enable those real world system designs to be materialised.

- HoLoVal - all the other components of the system (except possibly some parts of the philosophising) are purely instrumental in character.
This is the one where purpose and value are considered.

I also have a few older repos, at present static or moribund.:

- [Xi](https://www.github.com/rbjones/Xi)

  This was a place for me to explore the application of Deep Learning to theorem proving, and various other related matters.
  About to be repurposed as a repository for my ancient collections of explorations of various topics using ProofPower HOL and less formal philosophical essays, scribblings and notes.

- [pp-contrib](https://www.github.com/rbjones/pp-contrib)

  This is a fork of RobArthan's pp-contrib for me to add contributions to ProofPower.
  Nothing notable happened, and its not obvious that anything will happen, so it may well dissappear once I decide it serves no purpose.
  
- [www.rbjones.com](https://www.github.com/rbjones/www.rbjones.com)

  This is a git repo containing the build system for the web site www.rbjones.com, which contains most of the output from my intellectual wanderings over the period from about 1994 (and indeed, some things going back even as far as 1976).

  I am now in the process of mothballing this site as I transition to working only in github hosted development projects, and move some parts of the site into other repos.
  Once this is complete, the site will be purely of historical interest.
