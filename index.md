# [DA-Hol](https://rbjones.github.com/DA-Hol)

A project aiming at broad spectrum distributed application of automated and semi-automated deduction in Higher Order Logic.

### [DA-Value](https://github.com/rbjones/DA-Value)

A sister project to DA-Hol, not yet under way, concerning the formulation and implementation of value systems.

### [Xi](https://www.github.com/rbjones/Xi)

This is a place for me to explore the application of Deep Learning to theorem proving, and various other related matters.
  Hardly begun, since at the time I started it my ideas were moving pretty fast and I came up with the DA-Hol idea.
  It remains as a place for me to experiment.


### [pp-contrib](https://www.github.com/rbjones/pp-contrib)

  This is a fork of RobArthan's pp-contrib for me to add contributions to ProofPower.
  I started to rebuild one of my set theories here (as "ti") but didn't get very far.
  I also set out more recently to put in an interface as Standard ML structures to various Deep Learning packages.
  This connects with DA-Hol (and XI) but this bit might as well be a contrib to ProofPower.

### [www.rbjones.com](https://www.github.com/rbjones/www.rbjones.com)

This is a git repo containing the build system for the web site www.rbjones.com, which contains most of the output from my intellectual wanderings over the period from about 1994 to 2016.

I am now in the process of mothballing this site as I transition to working only in github hosted development projects.
  Once this is complete, the site will be purely of historical interest.
  I might also transfer the web site itself onto pages.github.io if I decide it should still be up.
