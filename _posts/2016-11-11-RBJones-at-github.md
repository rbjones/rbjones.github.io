Creation of this web-page repository is a first step in my transition to working entirely through github repositories, reflecting a change in philosophical method from attempting to write philosophy in books as a kind of global knowledge architecture, to building software around the same kind of philosophical kernel.

This is to be primarily through the new Distributed Autonomous Higher Order Logic (DA-Hol) project which seeks to establish infrastructure for the universal application of Deep Learning Deduction in all aspects of declarative knowledge and its application, including the kinds of application envisaged by the QED, Calculemus, Semantic Web, and to the formulation and administration of smart oracles, smart contracts and distributed autonomous organisaions.
