The StarDust constellation is still a movable feast, so I thought I would mention the recent moves before making a start at the wiki.

There are two problems with what I wrote in the blog about stardust (and which went into the StarDust repo README).

The first is that it doesn't make as clear as I would like that it is really all about AI.
So when the wiki appears it will be billed up front as an architecture for cosmic hyper-intelligence.
Yes, I do know that looks like gross hyperbole, I shall have to work hard to make the ideas sound credible.
I dropped the "Artificial" there because I am thinking forward to a time when the distinction between "artificial" and "natural" intelligence has become meaningless, and the "hyper-" reflects my intention to think forward way beyond what people now call "the singularity".

The other thing that I now don't like so much is the structure I had then sketched for this little constellation of repos.
I didn't have a diagram, but here's one from some recent correspondence:


                     StarDust ----------- CreativeDAO
                   /    |     \
                  /     |      \
                 /      |       \
                /       |        \
               /        |         \
         DA-Hol------SensAct-------DA-Value

When trying to describe how this works, it seemed to me that it is in fact rather more stack-like than this picture.
So this is a better picture:

                     StarDust ---------- CreativeDAO
                        |
                     DA-Value
                        |
                     SensAct
                        |
                     DA-Hol


in which CreativeDAO, which is not that important, sticks out like a sore thumb.
So I think I'll just take it out, and either do that work in DA-Value, or else outside this little constellation of projects.
Leaving just four layers to the StarDust cosmic hyper-intelligence stack.
So I'm hoping to begin fleshing out this high-level view in the StarDust repo over the next few days.
