As I have continued to work on the DA-Hol wiki, the scope of the aspiration has gradually widened.
Particularly, though I had not originally intended to do, or even think, much about how models of reality could be precisely connected with the real world, or how deductive reasoning might deliver real word effects, I found myself gradually putting together a fuller conception of how these things might work, even to the point of sketvhing in the DA-Hol wiki how proof technology could build a skyscraper, and feeling the need to introduce and embrace the concept of Global Brain.

Though I am interested in thinking and writing in the broadest terms about the potential for this technology, I do have some concern about how many of the core near-term target audience (particularly those interested in and competent in the development of proof technology) might be put off by materials straying too far from their zone of interest.

I decided therefore, to make a split, separating the purely logical side of the enterprise from the more speculative broader picture.
The logical core will be the newly refocussed DA-Hol project, the bigger picture still doesn't have a name.
Universal Intelligence has occurred to me, but I think it too long.

Any suggestions?

I already had another in mind, a "CreativeDAO" project, focussed on the kind of DAO that I think would be suitable for DA-Hol and possibly for many other creative projects.
The idea is that projects of which the major part is the creation of intelectual property would I believe be better done with a kind of constitution very different to the ones which we are seeing for DAO's.
The usual DAO contract seems to place it as a way of building and financing an organisation suitable for replacing the traditional Venture-Capital/IPO route, in which a new digital enterprise is rapidly built up by deploying large financial resources, in exchange for which the funding sources are given equity stakes.

The DAO improves on the now popular crowdfunding route by replacing all funding methods up to and including IPO by an ICO, in which the sales of a new crypto-digital asset raise funds in exchange for assets which have most of the benefits associated with equity stakes, but which so far have escaped the regulatory constraints which apply to private equity or IPOs.

These ways of establishing new digital businesses deploy large amounts of capital and must then make commensuate financial returns to the sources of the funds, as well as potentially yielding control to equity holders.
The financial side corrupts the service provisions that such an enterprise was developed to deliver, so that, for example, social media hubs, instead of remaining focussed improving the service to their users, become devoted to monetisation of the platform, generally through advertising.

This is not going to happen to DA-Hol.
Large amounts of capital (apart from _intellectual_ capital) will not be required, but there will be financial flows.
I have in mind a decentralised organisation which does issue a new class of digital asset which represent a financial stake in the enterprise, but which confer only financial benefits without any control.
Control remains throughout the life of the organisation with the creative contributors to the intellectual property which it is the purpose of the organisation to develop.
Control is based on status derived from community evaluations of technical contributions.

The tokens are not a means of raising capital, except possibly in very small amounts.

OK, this is an incomplete story here, particularly the story on how the financial side of CreativeDAO will work, for more see the CreativeDAO wiki, which I hope will expand on this story in the not-too-far-distant future.

So it looks like this cluster of new projects is now four in number, most of which will be very sketchy for some time to come.
